    <h4>Dear {{ name }}, you created car dealership <h3>{{ name_auto_salon }}</h3> with a location in {{ location }}
        on our website. In your car dealership when you create it you act as the owner. You can add three roles to you
    car dealership through an invitation to the car dealership. This is an admin - he will perform all the tasks
    that you perform. This is seller - he will publish listings and monitor them. This is a mechanic - he can receive
        request, like everyone else in your car dealership, from site visitors for car inspection or repair.
    Important: you cannot add more roles than described above. If you want to change someones role, either you
    or an admin need to delete someones role to put else in that role. Each role on uor website undergoes full
        registration and only after that can he send an invitation for a role in your car dealership.
    Important: you cannot add two identical roles, all roles in a car dealership are unique.
    We thank you for your trust in us! If you have any questions. dont hesitate to contact out support team</h4>
